## What is this?

The binary format of the Bedrock protocol, with no game logic attached. It is the lowest layer of
[Falcon](https://github.com/Falcon-MC/Falcon) and has no dependency on the server or the transport.

- **Packets** - one class per Bedrock packet in `Protocol/Packets`, each with `write`, `read` and a
  typed `handle` dispatch through `NetworkPacketHandler`
- **Packet ids and factory** - `MinecraftPacketIds` and `MinecraftPackets` create a packet from its id
- **Network types** - items, block definitions, inventory sources, commands, camera, attributes and
  more in `Protocol/Types`
- **Codecs** - items (inventory and entity formats), entity metadata, skins, inventory transactions,
  camera and data store
- **Utilities** - a JSON parser, math types and logging

NBT tags and binary streams come from [NBT](https://github.com/Falcon-MC/NBT), fetched automatically.

## Usage

The library is a plain CMake target named `FalconProtocol`. The easiest way to use it is
`FetchContent`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    falcon_protocol
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Falcon-MC/Protocol.git
    GIT_TAG main
    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(falcon_protocol)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FalconProtocol)
```

## Building

Only CMake 3.16+ and a C++17 compiler are required.

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```
